        <strong>Mobile Software Engineer (Mid-Level) - Syarah</strong><br />
        <em>Jun 2023 - Present 路 Remote</em>
        <p>
          Syarah is a multinational organization operating primarily in the Gulf
          region, specializing in digital automotive commerce. I work here as a
          Mid-Level Mobile Engineer, focusing on internal supply chain software.
        </p>
        <div class="job-details">
          <p>
            The work experience here is both challenging and enjoyable because
            of its unique projects that go beyond the typical mobile application
            work involving REST APIs. I worked on camera and gravity sensor
            validation, AI-driven object segmentation, and detection, object
            validation using CameraX and TFLite, developing a resumable
            background upload service with a queue, exploring Kotlin
            Multiplatform during KMM's early stages, and building Flutter apps
            with multiple modules.

            My primary responsibility was maintaining and evolving the Al-Hadith
            app. Initially, I supported its legacy Native Android version built
            with Java, before leading its migration to Flutter, achieving
            exceptional performance, smooth animations, and a maintainable
            architecture. I also briefly worked on the Quran Majeed project,
            where I developed an early Proof of Concept (POC) in Flutter.
