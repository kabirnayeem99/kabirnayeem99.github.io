MaxCode Lab is the software development division of IRD Foundation, a pioneer in digitalizing and making Islamic texts accessible in Bangla. Working here has been one of the best experiences of my life, thanks to its unique office culture rooted in Islamic values and principles, respectful relationships with management, and the profound opportunity to contribute to one of the country's most widely used applicationsâ€”trusted by both Ulama and the general public alike.

My primary responsibility was maintaining and evolving the Al-Hadith app. Initially, I supported its legacy Native Android version built with Java, before leading its migration to Flutter, achieving exceptional performance, smooth animations, and a maintainable architecture designed for long-term sustainability. Additionally, I briefly worked on the Quran Majeed project, where I developed an early Proof of Concept (POC) in Flutter.
