My First Professional Role as a Software Engineer. This role marked the beginning of my professional journey as a Software Engineer. During this time, I focused on learning design patterns and developed simple apps for personal use, such as university class schedule management and personal finance tracking. Despite being a contractual position, it allowed me to work on a wide range of projects with unique and diverse codebases, both legacy and modern, which significantly enhanced my code-reading and problem-solving skills.

- Contributed to 7-8 diverse projects for different clients, varying in scale and complexity, showcasing adaptability and technical proficiency across legacy and modern technologies.
- Maintained and enhanced a widely used job-finding application, utilizing legacy technologies like RxJava and Java 7.
- Played a key role in a high-impact product, Marriott Bonvoy, gaining experience in delivering solutions for a globally recognized brand.
- Took ownership of the full lifecycle development of BaseHubs, starting from its inception through deployment. Responsibilities included architectural planning, design, code leadership, code review, performance optimization, and ensuring the product's maintainability and scalability.
