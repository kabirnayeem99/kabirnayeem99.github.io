Syarah is a multinational organization operating primarily in the Gulf region, specializing in digital automotive commerce. I work here as a Mid-Level Mobile Engineer, focusing on internal supply chain software.

The work experience here is both challenging, and enjoyable because of its unique projects that go beyond the typical mobile application work involving REST APIs. 

Like I worked here with camera and gravity sensor validation, AI-driven object segmentation and detection, object validation using CameraX and TFLite, developing a resumable background upload service with a queue, exploring Kotlin Multiplatform during KMM's early stages, and building Flutter apps with multiple modules.
