During my time at IRD, to adjust to my first experience living alone outside the familiar environment of my university hall and the company of friends, I started taking on freelance gigs during evenings and weekends. Initially, these projects involved minor bug fixes, but they soon evolved into more challenging tasks. Notably, I worked on modifying an open-source Chinese VPN application and implementing a non-existent OneDrive MSAL package and Graph API in Flutter using a newly developed, undocumented Swift package.
