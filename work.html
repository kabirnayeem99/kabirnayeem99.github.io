        <strong>Mobile Software Engineer (Mid-Level) - Syarah</strong><br />
        <em>Jun 2023 - Present · Remote</em>
        <p>
          Developed in-house camera app with AI validation, worked on
          early-stage KMP projects and other unique projects.

            Syarah is a multinational organization operating primarily in the
            Gulf region, specializing in digital automotive commerce. I work
            here as a Mid-Level Mobile Engineer, focusing on internal supply
            chain software.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work experience here is both challenging and enjoyable because
            of its unique projects that go beyond the typical mobile application
            work involving REST APIs. I worked on camera and gravity sensor
            validation, AI-driven object segmentation, and detection, object
            validation using CameraX and TFLite, developing a resumable
            background upload service with a queue, exploring Kotlin
            Multiplatform during KMM's early stages, and building Flutter apps
            with multiple modules.

        <em>Oct 2022 - Sep 2023 · On-site, Bangladesh</em>
        <p>Worked on some of the most used apps in Bangladesh.</p>
        <div class="job-details">
          <p>
            MaxCode Lab is the software development division of IRD Foundation,
            a pioneer in digitalizing and making Islamic texts accessible in
            Bangla. Working here has been one of the best experiences of my
            life, thanks to its unique office culture rooted in Islamic values
            and principles, respectful relationships with management, and the
            profound opportunity to contribute to one of the country's most
            widely used applications—trusted by both Ulama and the general
            public alike.

          <p>
            My primary responsibility was maintaining and evolving the Al-Hadith
            app. Initially, I supported its legacy Native Android version built
            with Java, before leading its migration to Flutter, achieving
            exceptional performance, smooth animations, and a maintainable
            architecture designed for long-term sustainability. Additionally, I
            briefly worked on the Quran Majeed project, where I developed an
            early Proof of Concept (POC) in Flutter.

          <p>
            During my time at IRD, to adjust to my first experience living alone
            outside the familiar environment of my university hall and the
            company of friends, I started taking on freelance gigs during
            evenings and weekends. Initially, these projects involved minor bug
            fixes, but they soon evolved into more challenging tasks. Notably, I
            worked on modifying an open-source Chinese VPN application and
            implementing a non-existent OneDrive MSAL package and Graph API in
            Flutter using a newly developed, undocumented Swift package.

            developed simple apps for personal use, such as university class
            schedule management and personal finance tracking. Despite being a
            contractual position, it allowed me to work on a wide range of
            projects with unique and diverse codebases, both legacy and modern,
            which significantly enhanced my code-reading and problem-solving
            skills.
