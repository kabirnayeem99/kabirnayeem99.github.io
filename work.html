            <p>

              I've been working (as remote) on tools for their supply chain. Built an in-house Camera SDK with
              auto-capture and
              ML-based validation (YOLOv8). Also developed an in-house Upload Service SDK, a wrapper around WorkManager.

              Maintained and modernized the Al-Hadith app, one of the most popular Islamic apps in Bangladesh. Led the
              migration from legacy Android code to Flutter.

              Working here was truly one of the most amazing experiences of my life. The team was made up of all
              practicing
              Muslims, and the whole organization reflected that. We had Deeni Halaqas after Dhuhr, every decision was
              taken with Sharia compliance in mind, long holidays during the last 10 days of Ramadan, praying in jamat
              at the office- and honestly, the list goes on.

            <h3>Fiverr · Freelance Flutter Engineer</h3>
            <p class="meta">Mar 2023 — Jul 2023 · Remote</p>
            <p>
              Worked for a short period, mainly to fight off the loneliness after moving from my university dorm
              with friends to a rented house while working at IRD. Mainly worked on bug fixes. One of the significant
              work was
              developing a flutter package for OneDrive, with non-existent OneDrive MSAL package doc.

            <p>
              First professional role. Worked as a contractor, during my last two years of academic life. Worked on a
              lot of apps,

        <ul>
          <li>Pairing early to set direction, then documenting decisions as small notes others can extend.</li>
          <li>Keeping build pipelines boring—static analysis, fast feedback, reproducible environments.</li>
          <li>Attention to product tone: accessibility, microcopy, and the way apps guide users between screens.</li>
